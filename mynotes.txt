The Quote Card Express: Part 2
This Time on The Quote Card Express
In the last part of this project, you set up a project that uses Node and the Express package to serve a simple webpage. In this part, we're going to focus on the front-end. You will be working on creating a responsive quote card. You're goal is to replicate the mockup below, replacing the background image with an image of your own and displaying a quote of your choosing.

Overall, this will be a lesson to practice or flex your CSS skills.

Instructions
done - Inside your index.html, replace the contents of your body element with the html included below
done - Create a folder inside your public directory and name it js
done - Create a file named index.js and place it inside the js folder
done - Create another folder inside public named css
done - In the css folder, create reset.css and style.css
done - (named it keys.env) In the root level of your project, create a file named .env (we will be using this soon)
done - Download the mockup and place it in the root level of your project and name it mockup.jpg

Write your CSS to match the mockup below.

When you're finished, push your changes to GitHub and submit the link at the end of the lesson.


index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
    <title>Quote Card</title>

<body>
    <main class="main">
        <div class="background-img"></div>
        <article class="quote-container">
            <q id="quote" class="quote-text">The Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn't understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.</q>
            <p id="author" class="author-text">Eric Schmidt</p>
        </article>
    </main>


</body>
</html>



Add <script src="./js/index.js"></script> right before your closing body tag.


Please take note of the div with the class of background-img. 
Inside my style.css, that class contains the following property and value: background-image: url("../img/mitchell-luo-FWoq_ldWlNQ-unsplash.jpg"); 
This is how we are loading our image into the div. 
There's more to my styling, but this will be very important in this project.
